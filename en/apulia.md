Orecchiette with turnip greens, also known as "recchitelle" or "strascinati", is one of the most representative dishes of Puglia.
The secret of this dish lies in the perfect cooking of the vegetables together with the pasta; experience and knowledge of the ingredients ensure a perfect result.
Orecchiette with turnip greens is a traditional rustic dish, simple yet with a unique flavor, thanks to the combination of bold tastes inspired 
by sautéed turnip greens, a classic countryside side dish.

#### Ingredients
- 1 kg of turnip greens
- Salt
- 50 gr of breadcrumbs
- 30 gr of extra virgin olive oil

#### Preparation
1. Clean the turnip greens by removing the outer leaves and keeping only the inner ones, using a small knife or your hands.  
2. In the meantime, bring a large pot of water to a boil, adding salt to taste. This will be used to cook the turnip greens later.  
3. Pour half of the olive oil into a large pan and add the breadcrumbs. Toast over medium heat until golden brown.  
4. Once the water is boiling, add the cleaned turnip greens and cook them for about 5 minutes.  
5. After 5 minutes, add the pasta to the same pot and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.  
6. Stir gently, then drain the orecchiette and turnip greens.  
7. Add salt and the toasted breadcrumbs.

Frisella, or fresella, is a product of Apulian origin, but it is popular throughout Italy, especially in the south. 
It is a baked tarallo made from durum wheat (or whole wheat or barley), with a hard yet fragrant texture. 
One side is more porous, making it ideal for absorbing seasoning, while the other side is smoother.

#### Ingredients 
- Friselle
- 4 tomatoes
- Salt
- Olive oil
- Basilic

#### Preparation
1. Soak the friselle in non-chlorinated, room-temperature water for as long as you prefer—anywhere from a few seconds to a minute, depending on the desired moisture level.  
2. Cut the tomatoes into large pieces and drizzle the soaked friselle with extra virgin olive oil.  
3. Arrange the chopped tomatoes on top of the friselle, adding a few basil leaves for decoration.  

As you can see, preparing _friselle_ is extremely simple and quick, making it a perfect choice for a summer lunch.
