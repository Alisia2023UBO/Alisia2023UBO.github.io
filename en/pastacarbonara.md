*FRENCH VERSION*

### Pasta carbonara
Perhaps the first dish that springs to mind is one of the most famous in Italy. The _pasta alla carbonara_ or pasta carbonara is typical of the capital city of Rome. There are many hypotheses as to its origins, but none has been confirmed.

#### Ingredients
- 100 g pasta per person (often large spaghetti)
- Pecorino romano (an Italian cheese)
- Guanciale
- 2 eggs per person
- Black pepper

#### Preparation
1. Pour water into a saucepan with a little salt and bring to the boil.
2. When the water boils (and not before), pour in the pasta.
3. Leave to cook for about 10 minutes (but if you're using French pasta, check the cooking time often - sometimes it takes just five minutes for the pasta to be ready).
4. At the same time, take the guanciale and cut it into vertical pieces.
5. Cook the guanciale in a frying pan without adding oil (it's already very fatty).
6. Take the egg yolks and mix with the pecorino and black pepper.
7. Mix the pasta with the egg yolks and guanciale.
8. If necessary, you can add more cooking water to make it creamier.
