### Tiramisù

![alt text](tiramisu-classico.jpg)

The second dish I'm going to introduce you to is tiramisù, an Italian dessert made with coffee and crème fraîche. 
What I particularly love about this dish is the name: literally *tiramisu* in Italian means _make me feel better_.
Indeed, just tasting a small piece of this dessert is enough to make you feel better and happy again!

These are words my grandmother used to say to me all the time:
>> All you need is a little sugar to start the day off right.

The origins of tiramisù can be traced back to the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions of northeastern Italy. 
Legend has it that, while preparing an ice cream, Roberto Linguanotto dropped some mascarpone into a bowl containing a mixture of
sugar-egg mixture. Seduced by this mixture, he then presented it to Alba, Ado Campeol's wife, who then perfected the recipe 
recipe with her husband, adding sponge fingers, coffee and cocoa.

 Ingredients       | (Stove 20 x 30) 
-------------------|--------------------
750 gr of mascarpon|  120 gr of sugar            
300 gr of coffee   |  5 oeufs           
Cocoa              |  250 gr of savoiardi (biscuits)

#### Preparation
1. Prepare the 300g of coffee in a _moka_ and leave to cool.
2. Divide the egg whites from the yolks very **attentively**.
3. Beat the egg yolks with electric beaters, pouring in only half the sugar.
4. As soon as the mixture has become clear and frothy, and with the beaters still working, you can slowly add the mascarpone.
5. Clean the beaters thoroughly and whisk in the egg whites. When they are frothy, pour in the remaining sugar.
6. Take a spoonful of egg whites and pour into the bowl with the mascarpone cream.
7. Mix vigorously with a spatula.
8. Then add the remaining egg whites, stirring gently from bottom to top. The mascarpone cream is ready.
9. Dip the _savoiardi_ in the cold coffee and create a biscuit base in the pan.
10. Then add the mascarpone cream and continue with the cookies to make two layers.
11. When the tiramisù is complete, add cocoa.
