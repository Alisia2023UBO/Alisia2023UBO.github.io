## ITALIAN RECIPES
Feel like trying some Italian food, but don't know if you're following the right recipe? 
Here are some of the most popular recipes when it comes to Italian cuisine.

As an Italian studying in France, when I go shopping in supermarkets, I always see fake dishes presented as Italian, but which don't follow the original recipe at all. What bothers me a lot is that the majority of these dishes are not impossible to make, and their preparation is often very simple. That's why I decided to take this opportunity to create my first web page about Italian cuisine, one of the best in the world. 

What's more, I've chosen to present a few recipes typical of my region, Puglia, which are both very simple and delicious.  
These are **authentic** recipes, and an Italian woman guarantees it!

In the following list, you'll find a selection of dishes to choose from.

- [Tiramisù](tiramisù.md)
- [Pasta al pesto](pesto.md)
- [Recettes des Pouilles](apulia.md)
